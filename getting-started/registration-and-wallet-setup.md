# Registration and Wallet Setup

Airbills Pay operates on solana blockchain technology, meaning there’s no need for traditional account creation. Instead of signing up with your personal information, you simply connect your solana wallet to access the platform and start utilizing all the features.

### **Step 3: Depositing Funds into Your Wallet**

To interact with the platform, you'll need to deposit funds into your Web3 wallet. Airbills Pay supports deposits in popular stablecoins like **USDC** and **USDT**.

You can deposit funds from various sources:

* **Centralized Exchanges (CEX):** Transfer funds from exchanges like Binance, Bitget, or any other supported exchange.
* **Other Wallets:** You can also send funds from any other Web3 wallet.

### **Step 4: Ensure You Have SOL for Gas Fees**

For successful transactions, it's essential to have some **SOL (Solana's native token)** in your wallet to cover the network’s gas fees. These fees are typically very small but necessary to execute transactions on the Solana blockchain.

Gas fees on Solana are minimal, so you won’t need to worry about high costs. However, always ensure you have enough SOL in your wallet for smooth operations.
